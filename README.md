# Cuisine-Connect
Cuisine Connect is a full-stack food ordering platform built with the MERN stack. It allows users to browse restaurants, view menus, and place orders for individual meals or catering.
The app features JWT-based authentication for secure logins and integrates Stripe for payment processing. Admins can manage restaurant listings, including add, edit, and delete functions, and monitor orders with a real-time dashboard powered by Chart.js.
An AI chatbot, using Botpress, provides customer support. A review system lets users share feedback on restaurants and dishes. The app ensures smooth user experience and secure transactions throughout.
